🧴 SkinCare AI – AI-Powered Skin Analyzer  

 💡 Overview  
 
**SkinCare AI** is an intelligent dermatology assistant that uses AI to analyze your skin image and provide instant insights about your skin type, condition**,  summary, personalized morning and night routines, and wellness tips   
Just upload a photo, and the system will deliver **personalized skincare guidance** in seconds — private, simple, and science-backed.

🧠 How It Works  

1. 🖼️ **Upload a Skin Image** – The user uploads a clear photo of their skin from the Lovable interface.  
2. ⚙️ **AI Processing (n8n + Google Gemini)** – The workflow analyzes the photo using an AI model trained to identify patterns and textures.  
3. 🧾 **Instant Results** – The system returns a structured response including:  
   - 🌸 **Skin Type** (Oily, Dry, Combination, or Normal)  
   - 💧 **Condition Summary** (Health, hydration, and sensitivity analysis)  
   - 🌞 **Morning Routine** (Best cleansing and protection steps)  
   - 🌙 **Night Routine** (Care, recovery, and hydration tips)  
   - 💖 **Wellness Tips** (Lifestyle and nutrition advice for better skin health)

   ⚙️ Workflow Components
   
🧩 1. Webhook Trigger

Purpose: Receives the image sent from Lovable (Frontend).

Function: When a user uploads or sends a photo, the webhook captures it and starts the workflow automatically.

Response Setting: Configured to “Respond when last node finishes”, so the response is sent only after the AI analysis is complete — ensuring users receive the final, processed result.⚙️ Workflow Components
